# Changes to the original website
1. I deleted the original blog section and add the Blog CRUD page to my website.
   reason: My original page put too much information in one page, and the blog section is not styled, which is not good for the aesthetics of the website. In this way, the web page looks more succinct.
2. Change to a color scheme that has greater contrast: the original background color is a very light aliceblue. Now the website has a darker gradient background and an aliceblue font color.
3. Font is bigger (from 17px to 19px) to increase readability; also make headings of each section bigger and use another font for them.
4. The checkbox in the skills section are checked to show I have learned them.
5. Tried to improve image and content alignment.
   1. Resize the iframe and video so that their width do not exceed the break line
   2. Change an image for "music" so that the its length is not shorter than the others like the original one.
   3. Align the width of the header image with the hamburger menu.
6. Delete an image in the INTERESTS section since it is not meaningful given there is already a scenery image for "travelling".
7. Resize the header image so that it does not stretch vertically on small screens.

# Added JavaScript
1. Same to number 1. in the last section, the added Blog CRUD.
   reason: The original blog section cannot save posts since javascript is not used. Now, the usability of the website has been improved.
2. Add Google Analytics to my website.
3. Add the scrolling animation with main.js so that elements shows up gradually when scrolling down the page. Unlike the original version in which the interaction is not sufficient and present all information at once.
